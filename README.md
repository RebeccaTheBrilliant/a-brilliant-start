# a-brilliant-start

Hello, Lovelies! 

Rebecca the Brilliant here, finally beginning my journey into the programming world! 

I am currently taking the CS50x course from Harvard through edx.org, as well as learning some basic front-end coding skills (HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript) through Codecademy.com, and I believe I am ready to begin exploring with creating some things on my own. I look forward to this journey of learning and exploring all of the things that are possible in programming and coding. Thank you so much for dropping in, and I hope to see you in future projects!
